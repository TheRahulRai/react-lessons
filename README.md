# In this tutorial:
- Master React Fundamentals
- Build Reusable Components
- Render Data
- Handle Events
- Debug your React Apps

# Overview:
A javascript library for building user unterfaces

Components are piece of UI

every react app is essentially a tree of componenets

each component have a javascript class, a state and a render method

react works upon a virtual DOM or we can say its the react DOM and it syncs with the real DOM of the browser, so if any change happens in the react dom then it syncs with the real dom and we see the changes

so we don't need to attach any eventhandlers of javascript like:

```javascript
document.querySelector();
classList.add()
addEventListener()
```

**and thats why this library is called React, because it reacts to state changes**

## component based architecture

## Installation
### its going to install

- a light weight development server
- a webpack for bundleing our files
- and babel for compiling our javascript code

in index.html the div is the container for our react apps

JSX stands for javascript XML
babel converts this jsx to javascript code that browsers can understand

in import React from 'react';
1st React is the object and the 'react' is the module

in react we import React from 'react', but why?
because when our react code is compiled, babel uses React.createElements

**Hot module reloading** means that the app reloads automatically without saving
